Ahh I see 👌 — you don’t want a GPS-based map, but rather a **“range map” like a detector**, showing whether the object is **nearby, medium distance, or far** (based on signal strength / BLE RSSI).

That makes sense because your **Search Sticker device itself doesn’t have GPS** — it relies on **Bluetooth range detection**. So your map should behave more like a **radar / proximity detector** than Google Maps.

## 🎯 How to Design a Range-Based Map (Detector Style)

### 1. **Radar View (Best Visual)**

* Show a **circular radar** (like a sonar screen).
* The user’s phone (or gateway) is at the center.
* Each sticker appears as a **dot or icon**, placed closer/farther depending on signal strength (RSSI).
* Example:

  * -40 dBm → Very close → inner circle.
  * -70 dBm → Medium → middle circle.
  * -90 dBm → Far → outer circle.

### 2. **Heat Map View**

* Display a **colored gradient around user position**.
* Stickers represented as glowing points:

  * Green = close
  * Yellow = medium
  * Red = weak signal (far).

---

### 3. **Sector-based Detection**

* Divide radar into **4–6 sectors** (N, NE, E, SE, etc.).
* If multiple devices detected, place them in the sector with signal strength relative to center.
* Helps when scanning in different directions with phone.

## ⚙️ Implementation Options

### If using React Web App:

* Use **Canvas** or **D3.js** to draw radar circles.
* Use **TailwindCSS animations** for rotating radar sweep effect.
* Place sticker icons on the radar based on simulated RSSI values.

👉 Example Concept (pseudo-code):

```js
function rssiToRadius(rssi) {
  if (rssi > -50) return 50;   // close
  if (rssi > -70) return 100;  // medium
  return 150;                  // far
}
```

Then draw circles with icons at those radii.

## 🔮 Future Upgrade (When Hardware Ready)

* Phone app reads RSSI from BLE → passes signal strength to backend.
* Backend/web app → translates into radar position.
* If multiple gateways available → triangulation for approximate position inside factory/shop.

✅ So instead of a geographic map, your app can show a **radar detector view**, which looks cooler *and* matches your device’s capabilities.

Would you like me to **make a ready-to-use React component for this radar view**, so you can drop it into your Replit app and see stickers as dots moving on a detector map?
