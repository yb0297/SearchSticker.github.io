Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî you want a **web app** that simulates how your **Search Sticker** device will track objects. Since the real hardware (BLE + IR sticker) isn‚Äôt ready yet, the web will act as the **tracking dashboard** where users can see and manage stickers.

Here‚Äôs a clear plan for the **Search Sticker Tracking Web App**:

---

## üåê Web App Features

### 1. **User Dashboard**

* List of all registered stickers.
* Each sticker shows:

  * Object name (e.g., Laptop, Drill Machine)
  * Sticker ID
  * Sector (Office, Factory, Shop)
  * Battery %
  * Last seen timestamp
  * Status: OK / Low Battery / Not Found

---

### 2. **Add / Manage Stickers**

* **Add Sticker** ‚Üí form to register new sticker with ID and assign to an object.
* **Edit/Delete Sticker** ‚Üí update or remove an entry.

---

### 3. **Find Object Simulation**

* Each sticker entry has a **‚ÄúFind‚Äù button**.
* When clicked:

  * Object entry blinks/glows in UI (simulating IR response).
  * Optionally play a sound/animation in browser.

---

### 4. **Analytics Page**

* Charts showing:

  * % of stickers low on battery.
  * Distribution by sector (office / factory / luxury).
  * Average battery life remaining.

---

### 5. **Documentation Page**

* Short **about page** explaining:

  * What the Search Sticker is.
  * How it works (IR + BLE + button cell + app).
  * Costs and lifespan.
  * Benefits for office, factory, shop sectors.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Free & Open Source)

* **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS (fast, responsive UI).
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express (simulated API).
* **Database**: JSON file or SQLite (free, simple).
* **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js (free).
* **Icons**: Heroicons / FontAwesome.
* **Hosting**: Replit free tier.

## üìä Example Sticker Data (for simulation)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "STK001",
    "object": "Laptop",
    "sector": "Office",
    "battery": 78,
    "status": "OK",
    "lastSeen": "2025-10-01 14:30"
  },
  {
    "id": "STK002",
    "object": "Drill Machine",
    "sector": "Factory",
    "battery": 52,
    "status": "OK",
    "lastSeen": "2025-10-01 13:20"
  },
  {
    "id": "STK003",
    "object": "Display Case",
    "sector": "Luxury Shop",
    "battery": 20,
    "status": "Low Battery",
    "lastSeen": "2025-10-01 12:10"
  }
]
```

üëâ This app will **simulate tracking objects with stickers** until your hardware (BLE + IR sensor) is ready. Later, you can replace the mock JSON data with real BLE gateway integration.

Would you like me to **generate a starter React + Tailwind codebase** (dashboard + find button + mock JSON backend) so you can upload it straight to Replit and see it running?
